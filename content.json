X-axis and Y-axis of the graph represents year and frequency of plane accidents respectively. Size of plane is determined by the number of people onboard. 3 different plane sizes (Large, Medium, Small) are defined and separated by colors. The colors shown in the graph represent:-Blue： Large planes, number of people onboard &gt; 50-Red： Medium planes, 50 &gt; Number of people onboard &gt; 2-Yellow： Small planes, number of people onboard = 1 or 2 Medium plane has the highest number of plane accidents, while large planes tend to have the highest number of fatalities each year. The below trend suggests that a large proportion of total fatalities every year comes from accidents of large planes. Although accidents of small and medium planes are more frequent than that of large planes, accidents of plarge planes can be more devastating, because of the larger passenger capacity. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555684706000'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); Number of plane accidents and total fatalities by plane nature is displayed on the graphs below. Plane nature is separated into 4 categories: 1) Passengers, 2) Military, 3) Cargo, 4) Others. It can be seen from the graph that a large proportion of plane accidents and fatalities is linked to passenger planes. One of the possible explanations is that the majority of flight serves the purpose of carrying passengers, which may lead to higher number of accidents. Moreover, pilots in military planes can be more skilful, which results in fewer fatalities. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555685871896'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); Show the top airlines with the most accidents. The first two lines are private plane and US military aircraft.This is reasonable and consistent with the previous findings. Private small planes are more prone to occur accidents, while military aircraft are more likely to have trouble in harsh environments. Only the top fifteen are listed. You can see that American Airlines is the business compony with the most accidents. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555767987729'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"3.The Correlation of Factors with Death Rate","slug":"The-Correlation-of-Factors-with-Death-Rate","date":"2019-04-15T12:45:40.000Z","updated":"2019-04-21T02:22:31.629Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/15/The-Correlation-of-Factors-with-Death-Rate/","link":"","permalink":"https://sprayandpray.github.io/Visualization_Plane/2019/04/15/The-Correlation-of-Factors-with-Death-Rate/","excerpt":"","text":"The graph below illustrates the relationship between the severity of plane accidents and number of people onboard. X-axis and Y-axis contain the number of passengers and severity respectively. Severity of each accidents is defined by its mortality rate. A mortality rate of &gt;80% is considered as catastrophic. It is suggested that proportion of catastrophic accidents decreases as the number of people onboard increase. Large planes tend to have fewer accidents of large mortality rate. One of the possible reasons for this observation is that catastrophic accident is defined by proportion of mortality rate. As small planes have fewer passengers, accidents in small planes are more likely to be classified as catastrophic. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555750550491'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); The graph shows the relationship of flying hours with the occurence of catastrophic accidents. Y-axis represents the ratio of number of non-catastrophic and catastrophic accidents. (Ratio of number of accidents with small mortality rate and high mortality rate) Plane with more flying hours tend to have fewer catastrophic accidents than new planes. It can be suggested from the finding that planes with more flying hours tend to be more stable. New planes can be more susceptible to errors because errors may not be found within a short flight time. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555767208814'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); Correlation of crew and passenger survival rate is analyzed with the following graph. Survival rate, which is defined by number of fatalities / total number of people onboard, is calculated for each accidents. Crew and passenger survival rate are then plotted to analyze their correlations. There is a positive correlation between crew and passenger survival rate. This suggests that passengers are less likely to survive in an accident if most crews cannot survive. The key message is that survivability of crew is important to that of the passengers. In order to reduce the number of fatalities of passengers, it is essential to increase the survivability of crews. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555757388625'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); Another heat map is generated to further investigate the relationship between crew and passenger survival rate. It is noted that most of the data points cluster around (0%,0%) and (98%,100%). This suggests that most of the plane accidents have either 0 fatalities, or a large mortality rate. The heat map further reinforces the idea that the survivability of crew members are important to the survivability of passengers. var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1555644891030'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px'; var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"4.Accident Cause Analysis","slug":"Accident-cause-analysis","date":"2019-04-14T03:11:37.000Z","updated":"2019-04-21T04:05:13.285Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/14/Accident-cause-analysis/","link":"","permalink":"https://sprayandpray.github.io/Visualization_Plane/2019/04/14/Accident-cause-analysis/","excerpt":"","text":"test ,test of crashes caused by this sequence of reason Legend // Hack to make this example display correctly in an iframe on bl.ocks.org d3.select(self.frameElement).style(\"height\", \"700px\");","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"5.Project Report","slug":"Project-Report","date":"2019-04-12T14:44:00.000Z","updated":"2019-04-21T02:49:23.751Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/12/Project-Report/","link":"","permalink":"https://sprayandpray.github.io/Visualization_Plane/2019/04/12/Project-Report/","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"6.about","slug":"about","date":"2019-04-11T15:34:02.000Z","updated":"2019-04-21T02:49:33.597Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/11/about/","link":"","permalink":"https://sprayandpray.github.io/Visualization_Plane/2019/04/11/about/","excerpt":"","text":"Our website is published at Github!
