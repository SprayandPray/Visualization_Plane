## Foreword
- The goal of this project is to identify trends/patterns of big plane crashes, by visualizing data of plane crashes over time and locations.   

- We are looking forward to finding some inspirations by analyzing the number of crashes distributed in different time, location and so on. The death rate of the crash is our point as well. We managed to derive the relationship between the rate and specific factor.

## Tools we use  

- Python：Python has been used for data scraping and cleaning. It provides us with a great way to gain more data, and process data more efficiently.  
 
- Tableau：Use the powerful data processing software to visualize and put the animation on the public server. We aim to provide a set of intuitive and interactive visualization to help users understand more of data.  

- D3: D3.js is open-source and has a large user community.Visualizations are fully customizable. Possible to create highly interactive displays of data.  

- Website: Node.js brings incredible generating speed. Hundreds of files take only seconds to build.Hexo is a fast, simple & powerful blog framework, which helps us input command to deploy  website to GitHub Pages.
